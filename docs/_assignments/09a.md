## Code
__Due: April 18__

- Building off of  the basicThresholding, backgroundSubtraction, and colorDistance example, create an app that either-
    1. Draws something to the screen only when you move or when something in the camera scene changes dramatically.
    2. Has you (or your body) interact with something on the screen.
- __Limitations__
    - Do not just draw circles at different sizes for pixels.
    - After an initial setup, you should not have to touch the computer.

- Think about what you would like to do for your final project.
    - What is the _content_?
    - Your project should go deep into one topic and not just a demonstration of the technology.
    - Build on homework and code presented in class. Take inspiration from the artists and works presented. Iteration is good, repetition not so good.
    - We will meet and discuss your project in class next week and come up with a plan and schedule.
    - I will post more inspirational resources on the resources page.
